# GalaxyEconomics
This is going to be an economic simulation between nodes. The nodes are represented by stellar objects in 3d Space. 
Starlanes are connections between stellar objects.
Trading fleets can travel along starlanes to carry stuff from place to place. 
The basic trading goods are  all elements up until element 118, oganesson. 
Each orbital body, orbiting a stellar object, and each natural satellite orbiting an orbital body, 
will have one or more resource groups (Halogens, Chalcogens etc.)  The elements in this group will be produced
each turn on that particular nody. 
The shortage of elements that are not locally mined (per orbital body) will have to be imported, creating a deman-supply mechanism. 
Spontaneously, new molecules can be created. This mechanism will also create additional demand, as these new molecules will be part of a mechanism
of providing happiness.
New molecules will also create new technologies. The creation of that particular new molecule will be a new technology. Orbital bodies will need that technology,
to be able to create that particular molecule themselves.

There is a controllable faction and controllable fleets that are player owned. Not much can be done with them at the moment though.
