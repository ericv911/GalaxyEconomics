wien's displacement law

study electron orbitals
electronegativity
oxidation states.

Time
- 1 universal year, month and day.
- each stellar system has it's own year, month and day cycle

Ships
- ships → finish destination-setting (for AI-ships  set multistep trajectory
- cargoships → add cargohold
- ships can follow other ships
- ships. add hullpoints
- ships add laser  object
- weapons class
- laser class
- create warship class
- own ship, remember entire path. 
- for all ships.  Do not go back to previous destination.

Importing .dat
- clear imported datafiles from non-valid symbols, before writing that data to ingame basetypes

Trade   (see also paper sketch) 
= Trade fleets: for AI planets, setup automatic trading to reach equilibrium
- Trade:
Infrastructure , for interstellar travel and internal in star systems . Internally, amongst others it determines the speed of loading and unloading of ships. 
Storage of resources. 

Energy production
Energy production and storage.

Mining
Technology levels for Mining, Refining, Processing, Electrolysing etc. 
each type of building will have associated tech level.  higher level of building requires higher tech-level  

TechLevel
- Fill  techlevel-type collection from External .dat file. 

Starlanes 
- make selectable on screen
- Specifically for starlanes, Some way to include relative occurence of techlevel-distribution to starlanes

Stellarobject
- redo abs. magnitude from Black Hole and neutron stars)
- Calc abs Magnitude from Radius and temperature.
-  standard mass generation of stars. (for main sequence)  Add type after mass generation. Only works for the main sequence stars. 
- has AI tradefleet to trade orbital body goods with neighboring systems
- can autodistribute resources and goods amongst its own orbital bodies over time
-  Add metallicity to Stellar-Objects  from .dat file. Increased metallicitiy will increase extraction modifiers. 
- Change name of planets and stars. Standard a bit more eleborate stellar name generation

Orbitalbody 
- orbital body can have 3 farms of tech level 3, 1 spaceport of techlevel 4, 6 housing of tech level 2 etc.  
- grow food per season or something like that
- food used on screen
- graph total food and population statistics over time
- add farm-techlevel
- Immigration and Emigration system
- if people immigrate to planet without buildings, generate farm + housing level 1;
- farm needs people to operate. variable output depending on people available to work in it.  (affected by happiness)
- add happiness and all things related to sustaining a population (including androids and cyborgs.)  types of races. 
- resourcesinstorage,  add modifier (*rand) from resourcegroup .dat file)   
-  Smaller orbital bodies can be created from larger ones after destruction of het larger orbital body.  A dwarf planet of mass X could be  converted to 3 asteroid and a dwarf planet with combined mass < X. These can then have additional resource groups exposed for extraction.

Resources
- spontaneously combine to form new molecules. 
this new molecule becomes a valuable trade asset, generate happiness and it's production will become a new technology. 
neighboring systems will start buying the new molecule. after enough trade. tech will spread slowly
after enough tech spreading. tech will be available globally.
- for diatomic molecules. level 1 factory
- for triatomic molecules level 2 factory etc.

Optimize
- stellar and orb body generation.  first bare stellar objects and orbital bodies.  after that set properties. That way. all things can be set up in the appropriate class itself   -->
i.e Orbital bodies set up as much as possible in orbital bodies class.  etc.
- starlane creation.  do in intertwined batches. recombine batches with some starlanes between them. Should save up lots of calculation
- always recheck all calculations.
- unit-testing

Screen-layout
-  On screen string areas. -> make general Converter from int to string :  methods return int. Converter converts int to standard strings. Other methods can still pass -  strings of their own to overview.text
- create region of color from the economic entity that controls it around stellarobject
- Draw Lines to Border of the screen
-  3d Animation ships
- Highlight groups of objects that have the same owner (ships and stellar objects).
- select between star color and economic entity color for stellar objects

CodeBehind
- Models  -> own namespace

List of building types still to do

Electrolyser
Chemical Plant
Metal refinery
Metal Smelter 
Hydroponics 
Genetics institute
Government buildings.
Bio-Industry
Happiness buildings
Food refineries. 
Farm Lands, Cattle Lands, 
Other categories : military, civil, gov't, trade, resource prod.

Combine several .dat files to create new buildings – >   
1. .dat building types.
2. .dat other property types (properties of orbital bodies, ships, starlanes etc)
3. Combine 1 and 2 to form new buildings in another .dat file
building will have name, building type, and properties from multiple .dat files.
Important to keep track what kind of properties it has. Needed for proper calculation. 


Known Bugs

after stellar generation. If number of ships is decreased, program will crash during another stellar generation.
scrollbar of the scrollviewer to the left does not work for some reason
